# Introducing Our Summer Signature Flavor

We're excited to announce our new summer signature flavor: **Strawberry Fields Forever**!

## Local Berries, Global Inspiration

This new creation celebrates the start of BC strawberry season with a recipe that combines the best local strawberries from Richmond farms with a hint of balsamic reduction and fresh basil.

The inspiration came from a classic Italian pairing of strawberries with balsamic vinegar, but we've added our own Rollz twist by incorporating it into our smooth vanilla base and adding tiny pieces of shortbread cookie for texture.

## Limited Time Only

Strawberry Fields Forever will be available at all Rollz Vancouver locations starting May 15th through the end of July (or while supplies last). Due to the seasonal nature of local strawberries, once they're gone, this flavor hibernates until next summer!

## Perfect Pairings

Our ice cream artisans recommend trying this flavor with:
- A drizzle of honey
- Fresh mint leaves
- Crushed pistachios
- White chocolate shavings

## Sustainability Commitment

As part of our commitment to supporting local agriculture and reducing our carbon footprint, all strawberries in this special flavor come from farms within 30km of Vancouver. The shortbread cookies are baked fresh in our Gastown kitchen.

Stop by and try this summer sensation before it's gone!
