# Our Story

## From Thailand to Vancouver

Rollz Vancouver was founded in TK by food enthusiasts 

## What is Rolled Ice Cream?

Unlike traditional ice cream that's churned and frozen in batches, rolled ice cream is made to order on a frozen metal plate chilled to -20Â°C. We pour our liquid base onto the cold surface, add mix-ins, then chop, mix, spread, and roll it into beautiful spirals. The result is a fresher, creamier ice cream with a unique texture that's as beautiful as it is delicious.

## Our Philosophy

At Rollz Vancouver, we believe in:

- **Quality ingredients**: We source local dairy, fruits, and premium imported flavors.
- **Handcrafted excellence**: Each order is made personally by our trained ice cream artists.
- **Creative expression**: We continuously experiment with new flavors and combinations.
- **Community connection**: We partner with local suppliers and participate in community events.
- **Sustainable practices**: Our cups and spoons are made from compostable materials.
